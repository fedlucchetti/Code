# Wassim's C++ exercices

## Description

The purpose of these exercises is to teach you how to code in C++. For this we prepared a simple project that you need to implement and will help you to understand simple BFT, HotStuff algorithms from a programmatic point of view.  The main concept that are covered here, and that are going to be fundamental for you to become a successful researcher in CS are the following:

- Learn the basics C++ concepts (memory allocation, buffers, headers, types) and what makes it different from any other kind of programming language that you are familiar with.
- Write your own Makefile
- Use other libraries (TCP, Threads,...)
- Write your own custom classes

The most important take-away will be to nurture your programming skills which are going to be indispensable when trying to implement/prototype your ideas for new kind of protocols/algorithms.
